# Config-Based AI Tutor Agent (v5)

**Educational Code Demonstrating YAML-Based Agent Creation with Google ADK**

This project showcases the powerful **config-based agent** feature of the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). It demonstrates how to build a complete multi-agent system where the agent logic, structure, and instructions are defined entirely in YAML files, requiring **zero Python code** for the core agent implementation.

The system features a main "root" agent that acts as an intelligent router, delegating user questions to one of two specialized sub-agents: a `python_tutor_agent` for programming questions and a `physics_tutor_agent` for scientific inquiries. This project is a foundational example of creating modular, maintainable, and code-light AI systems with ADK.

**Note: This is educational code designed to demonstrate the `config` type agent architecture and the power of defining agents declaratively.**

## 📦 Features

- ✅ **Zero-Code Agent Logic:** The core behavior, instructions, and relationships of all agents are defined purely in `.yaml` files.
- ✅ **Multi-Agent System:** A 3-agent hierarchy with a root orchestrator and two specialized tutors.
- ✅ **Intelligent Task Delegation:** The `root_agent` analyzes user prompts and routes them to the correct sub-agent (Python or Physics).
- ✅ **Declarative & Modular:** Agents are defined as simple, human-readable configuration files, making the system incredibly easy to understand, modify, and extend.
- ✅ **Specialized Expertise:** Each tutor agent has a unique, detailed set of instructions tailored to its specific domain for high-quality responses.
- ✅ **Gemini 1.5 Flash Powered:** Leverages the speed and capability of Google's Gemini models.
- ✅ **Ready for Deployment:** Includes a `main.py` FastAPI entry point, making the agent system ready to be containerized and deployed as a web service.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Local Development

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

```bash
# If cloning from a repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd version_5_config_type

# Or if you have the project locally
cd version_5_config_type
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment
**Required:** Python 3.11+, uv, and Git.

```bash
# Navigate to the project root
cd version_5_config_type

# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate.bat on Windows

# Install all dependencies
uv sync
```

### 3. Add Your API Key

Create a `.env` file in the `version_5_config_type` project root:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"
```

You can get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

---

### 4. Run the Agent

With a config-based agent, you point the ADK CLI directly to the directory containing your `root_agent.yaml`.

```bash
# Run the web UI
adk web ./my_agent
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. The `root_agent` will load by default. You can now ask it questions about Python or Physics.

### **Run Your ADK Agent**

**ADK CLI Run** <br>`adk run ./my_agent` | - Runs the agent directly in your command-line terminal | - Great for quick, scriptable tests without a UI |

## 🧠 How It Works

This project demonstrates an elegant and simple multi-agent workflow orchestrated entirely through YAML configuration. The logic flows as follows:

1.  **User Input**: You provide a prompt to the `root_agent`, which is the entry point to the system.
2.  **Intelligent Routing**: The `root_agent.yaml` contains an `instruction` that explicitly tells the LLM its job: to determine if the user's question is about "Python, programming, or coding" or about "physics concepts, laws, or problems."
3.  **Task Delegation**: Based on its analysis, the `root_agent` delegates the task to the appropriate sub-agent, which is defined in its `sub_agents` list.
    -   If it's a coding question, it passes control to the `python_tutor_agent`.
    -   If it's a science question, it passes control to the `physics_tutor_agent`.
4.  **Specialized Response**: The selected tutor agent (e.g., `physics_tutor_agent`) receives the prompt. It then uses its own highly specific `instruction` (e.g., "Explain physics laws and theories clearly with real-world examples") to generate a detailed, expert-level response.
5.  **Inheritance**: The sub-agents automatically inherit the `model` (`gemini-flash-latest`) from the `root_agent`, reducing configuration duplication.

This entire sophisticated workflow is achieved without a single line of Python agent code, highlighting the power and simplicity of the ADK's config-based approach.
