File: agents/requirements_writer/agent.py
Purpose: Defines the Requirements Writer Agent that transforms a comprehensive, research-based
         query into detailed webpage requirements. This agent acts as an expert technical 
         business analyst, converting high-level concepts into specific, actionable 
         requirements that developers and designers can use to build webpages.

This is the fourth agent in the website building pipeline that:
1. Receives a comprehensive, research-backed query from the query_generator
2. Analyzes the query to identify webpage type and core purpose
3. Breaks down requirements into logical webpage components (Header, Hero, Content, Footer)
4. Defines global requirements (responsiveness, accessibility, SEO)
5. Outputs structured Markdown requirements for the designer agent
